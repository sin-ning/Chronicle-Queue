== Chronicle Queue Enterprise Replication

Chronicle Queue Enterprise replication performs simple uni-directional, multi-way replication by copying a Chronicle queue from one host, to one or more other hosts using TCP/IP.

NOTE: For Chronicle Engine-based replication, see link:engine-replication.adoc[engine-replication.adoc].

=== The mechanics of Chronicle Queue Replication

The queue that we write to is known as the `source` queue. The copy(ies) is the `sink` queue.

IMPORTANT: Chronicle requires exclusive write access to the `sink`. The `sink` should be treated as read-only, and never written to manually.

If we allowed messages to be written to the sink, it is easy to imagine a case where different messages are written to a `source` and `sink` at the same time. The messages on the `source` queue and `sink` queue could now be in a very different order. Because of this situation we do not allow messages to be written to the `sync` queue, Queues must maintain message ordering, and ensure that the `source` queue and `sink` queue are identical. 

One of the reasons that we enforce this is that, in a microservices architecture, in order that you can get true 'replay-ability', you should be able to guarantee the consistency, and ordering, of the messages in queues. Therefore, any service that is running on the `source` machine must receive the same events, and in the same order, as the service running on the `sink` machine.

Any message that is written to the `source` is copied to the `sink`. The `sink` therefore becomes a mirror image of the `source`.

At startup, replication locks the `source` queue, and waits for the `sink`(s) to report the number of records it has. If the `sink` has more records, they are replayed back to `source` before it is unlocked and made usable again. This is done to provide automatic data re-synchronisation after a failover to the `sink`.

The set of hosts onto which the queue is replicated, is defined as a `cluster`. The configuration for a cluster is as follows:

```
!QueueReplicationCfg {
  cluster: {
    context: !QueueClusterContext {
      heartbeatIntervalMs: 300000,
      heartbeatTimeoutMs: 500000,
      baseSourcePath: "replica/source",
      baseSinkPath: "replica/sink",
    }

    host1: {
      hostId: 1,
      connectUri: host.port1,
    }
    host2: {
      hostId: 2,
      connectUri: host.port2,
    }
    ...
  },

  queues: {
    queue1: {
      path: "queue1",
      acknowledge: false,
      masterId: 1,
    }
  }
}
```

In the configuration shown above, the queue, `queue1`, is set to be replicated from `host1` (as indicated by `masterId`) to all other hosts defined for the cluster.

Queues will use storage paths defined by `baseSourcePath` and `baseSinkPath` for `source` and `sink`, respectively, followed by the queue name. For this example, the `source` queue will be at `replica/source/queue1`, while the `sink` will be written to `replica/sink/queue1`.

=== Using Enterprise Queue Replication

To start replicating data, the user must create an instance of `ReplicatedQueue` for each host. This is done as follows:

```
ReplicatedQueue repl = new ReplicatedQueue(config(), hostId);
repl.startReplication();
...
// shutdown
repl.shutdown();
```

==== Example from a test case

[source,java]
```
@Test
public void shouldReplicate() throws Exception {

    YamlLogging.setAll(false);
    IOTools.deleteDirWithFiles("replica", 10);
    TCPRegistry.createServerSocketChannelFor(
            "host.port1",
            "host.port2",
            "host.port3");

    startupHost((byte) 1);
    startupHost((byte) 2);

    ReplicatedQueueCfg qCfg = CONFIG.queues().values().stream().filter(q -> q.path.equals("queue1")).findFirst().orElseGet(() -> {
        fail("Queue queue1 not found");
        return null;
    });
    QueueClusterContext ctx = CONFIG.cluster().clusterContext();
    assert ctx != null;
    SingleChronicleQueue source = QueueBuilderFromConfig.queueFromConfig(qCfg, CONFIG::queueConfig, path -> ctx.getSourcePath(path, (byte) 1));
    SingleChronicleQueue sink = QueueBuilderFromConfig.queueFromConfig(qCfg, CONFIG::queueConfig, path -> ctx.getSinkPath(path, (byte) 2));

    ExcerptTailer tailer = sink.createTailer();

    assertNull(poll(tailer, 200L));

    ExcerptAppender appender = source.acquireAppender();

    try (DocumentContext dc = appender.writingDocument()) {
        dc.wire().write("test").text("Hello replica");
    }

    String poll = poll(tailer);
    assertEquals("Hello replica", poll);

    try (DocumentContext dc = appender.writingDocument()) {
        dc.wire().write("test").text("Hello replica2");
    }

    poll = poll(tailer);
    assertEquals("Hello replica2", poll);

    poll = poll(tailer, 500L);
    assertNull(poll);
}
```
